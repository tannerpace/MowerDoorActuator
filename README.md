# Mower Door Actuator

## Hardware List

- **ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1**  
  *Espressif Systems Development Board*
- **NOYITO AC to DC 12V 8A Isolated Power Supply Module**  
  Converts AC 120V (110-260V) to DC 12V 8A (54W, peak 8A) with overcurrent, overload, and short-circuit protection.
- **2 Channel DC 5V Relay Module with Optocoupler Relay**
- **VEVOR Linear Actuator 12V, 12 Inch High Load 330lbs/1500N Linear Actuator**  
  Includes a mounting bracket and has IP54 protection.

## Software Environment & Setup

### Arduino IDE / PlatformIO

- **Arduino IDE:**  
  - Install the latest version from the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
  - In **Tools â†’ Board â†’ Boards Manager**, install **"ESP32 by Espressif Systems"**.  
  - **Select your board:** Choose the ESP32-C6 entry



## Code Overview

The code handles:
- **Wi-Fi Connection:** The device connects to your specified Wi-Fi network.
- **Web Server:**  
  - Serves a simple GUI to send commands for extending, retracting, or stopping the actuator.
  - Uses Materialize CSS for a responsive design.
- **Actuator Control:**  
  - `extendActuator()`, `retractActuator()`, and `stopActuator()` manage relay outputs.
  - A `Ticker` is used to automatically turn off power to the relay after 90 seconds, the actuator is one that has built in overdrive control but this is just a precaution.
- **HomeSpan Accessory:**  
  - Exposes the actuator as a HomeKit accessory with a switch interface.
  - Pairing is set with the code `83722189`.

I later removed the HomeKit dependency and am serving a web UI using vanilla JavaScript and HTML, I saved the website directly under my phone and interact with them overdoor with just a few clicks. 

## Usage

1. **Compile and Upload:**  
   - Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
   - Verify and upload the code to your ESP32-C6 board. 
   
2. **Connect to Wi-Fi:**  
   - The board will connect to your Wi-Fi network. Find the ip address by accessing the admin panel of your router, note the new devices Look for the new ip address. 


Finding Your Deviceâ€™s IP Address

To access the web interface, youâ€™ll need to know the ESP32â€™s IP address on your local network. The most reliable way is to scan your network:

ðŸ“¡ Scan for IP Addresses

Mac (Terminal):

sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

Replace 192.168.1.0/24 with your networkâ€™s subnet if different.
You can find your subnet by running ifconfig and looking for your local IP.

Windows (PowerShell or Command Prompt):

1. Install Nmap.


2. Run:

nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

   
3. **Access the Web Interface:**  
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://<BOARD_IP_ADDRESS>/`.
   - verify the page is accessible, i perfer homeassistant to control the actuator, however it is also working on local network at the page.
    
### Partitioning

When using the Arduino IDE, set your partition scheme via **Tools â†’ Partition Scheme**:
- select a scheme 
 **"Minimal (2mb NO OTA partition)"**   2 MB per partition.


**Connections:**

1. **NOYITO Power Supply**:
   - Input:
     - Connect AC 120V (hot line) and neutral to input terminals.
   - Output:
     - Connect DC +12V (positive) to relay module VCC.
     - Connect DC GND (negative) to relay module GND and ESP32 GND (Green wire).

2. **ESP32 DevKitC-1**:
   - 5V Pin (Yellow wire) to 5V power input on Relay Module.
   - GND Pin (Green wire) to common ground (Power supply and relay GND).
   - GPIO Pin 18 (Blue wire) to Relay IN1.
   - GPIO Pin 19 (Purple wire) to Relay IN2.

3. **2-Channel Relay Module**:
   - Connect Relay outputs:
     - Relay Channel 1 NO (normally open) to Actuator Positive terminal.
     - Relay Channel 2 NO (normally open) to Actuator Negative terminal.
     - Both Relay Common (COM) terminals connected to +12V and GND respectively from power supply.

4. **VEVOR Linear Actuator**:
   - Positive and Negative terminals connected to relay output as described above.

**Color Coding:**
- Green: Ground
- Yellow: +5V DC
- Blue: GPIO Pin 18
- Purple: GPIO Pin 19
- Red: +12V DC
- Black: DC Negative / GND

Ensure the connections are properly insulated and secured. Mount all components within a protective enclosure to avoid moisture and dust ingress.
